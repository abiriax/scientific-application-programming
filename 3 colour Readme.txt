READ ME for 3 colour.c

the code is designed to run a torodial (think doughnut) simulation of a hexagonal lattice in which each vertex has an assigned colour, namely red, green or blue (assigned in the code as 0,1, and 2 resepectively). Opposing sides of the hexagons with equal colours are given an value of 1 in heat. The system is then used to study the cooling behaviour’s of materials with different co-efficents of heating (see the J factor file, which is currently on an internal server which i have requested to access). The code is fully functional with the addition of random number generator subroutine and seedfile.
